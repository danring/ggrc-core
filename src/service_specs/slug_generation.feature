Feature: Slugs should be generated when not provided

  Background:
    Given service description

  Scenario Outline: A Slugged resource is POSTed without a slug and a slug is generated.
    Given a new "<resource_type>" named "slugged_resource"
    And "slugged_resource" property "slug" is literal "None"
    And "slugged_resource" is POSTED to its collection
    When GET of the resource "slugged_resource"
    Then evaluate "context.slugged_resource.get('slug') is not None"
    And evaluate "context.slugged_resource.get('slug').startswith('<resource_type>'.upper())"

  Examples:
      | resource_type  |
      | Control        |
      | DataAsset      |
      #| Directive      |

  Scenario Outline: A Slugged Section is POSTed without a slug and a slug is generated.
    Given a new "<directive_type>" named "directive"
    And "directive" is POSTED to its collection
    And a new "Section" named "slugged_resource"
    And "slugged_resource" property "slug" is literal "None"
    And "slugged_resource" link property "directive" is "directive"
    And "slugged_resource" is POSTED to its collection
    When GET of the resource "slugged_resource"
    Then evaluate "context.slugged_resource.get('slug') is not None"
    And evaluate "context.slugged_resource.get('slug').startswith('<slug_prefix>')"

  Examples:
      | directive_type | slug_prefix |
      | Contract       | CLAUSE      |
      | Policy         | SECTION     |
      | Regulation     | SECTION     |

    Given a new "<resource_type>" named "slugged_resource"
    And "slugged_resource" property "slug" is "SLUG-FOR-<resource_type>"
    And "slugged_resource" is POSTed to its collection
    When GET of the resource "slugged_resource"
    Then evaluate "context.slugged_resource.get('slug') == 'SLUG-FOR-<resource_type>'"

  Examples:
      | resource_type  |
      | Control        |
      | DataAsset      |
